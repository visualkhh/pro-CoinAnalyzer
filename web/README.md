[live](https://smartadmin-angular.firebaseapp.com) demo

## AOT Note
Starting from version 0.4.5 we are supporting AOT builds.  
 
use `npm run build:aot` to run AOT build
 
if you'll get `FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory` use `npm run build:aot2` or increase node memory heep size even more (check `package.json` `scripts` section for details) 


## Prerequisites

Make sure latest [angular-cli] installed globally. Follow [update-how-to](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#updating-angular-cli)  

This project has dependencies that require **Node 4.x.x and NPM 3.x.x**.

For Windows users [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is perfect **terminal**-window to manage nodejs projects. [1]
 
 
## Installation

1. Download and unpack
2. Run `npm i`. This may take a while. It may even *freeze* a bit on final steps - be patient. 
  * Also Remember, that npm on installing project dependencies may try to rebuild some modules (i.e *gyp*) and show scary red errors on that rebuild fails. Don't panic. If your `npm install` ends with long tree of project dependencies - then you are going right way. Nevermind deprecation WARNs. 

3. To start whole app template (this means a lot of initial compilation) in local dev server run
  * `npm run server`
  * or checkout *cookbook* section for some starting tips
4. Point your browser to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

#### tip 
quick way to speed up builds when testing 
* exclude whole template parts from compilation by commenting them in `src/app/app.routing.ts`

## Build
* Run `npm run build` to build the project. 
* The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
* checkout how excluding routes from *.routing.ts file reduces *.chunks.js count.
* dev build off app with dozen routes/pages takes comparatively acceptable time (~ 1 min)
* inspect built chunks, just to get idea how 
* Use the `npm run build:prod` for a production build.
* On huge app prod build may take more than 10 mins. On the final step it may look frozen completely. Be patient. Alocate at least 1Gb of free RAM. Consider to do some exersizes or tee while waiting.  
   * production code goes through optimizations, minifying, uglyfying, tree-shaking algorithm  -  but that's just price for nice chunked minimalist builds. 
   * there are some code rules, how to help tree-shacking compilers to do their [job](http://www.2ality.com/2015/12/webpack-tree-shaking.html)
    
#### tip 
write shell scripts for build/deploy/whatever routines automation


## Smartadmin Angular 5 templates

Smartadmin will be supplied with 3 templates: 
* *full* - full demo application
* *blank* - app with simple Home page. All demo pages are also there  but they are excluded from build by default
* *lite* - good starting point for creating smartadmin app with no extra dependencies (like jquery) 


## Some useful code stuff

* Switching app root-layouts according to route (e.g. different layout for login/register pages) 
* Lazy loading everywhere - routing and plugins 
* Animating routes with Decorators
* hot module replacement
* Google Map - async map initializer 
* Image editor - Angular 2 application with Redux data flow 
* CK Editor - loading scripts from cdn
* and much more 


## Testing
Testing is important for big projects. So we have good old js combo!

App is configured for running end-to-end (via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/)) and unit (via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)) tests

`npm run e2e` shortcut for executing end-to-end tests. 
`npm run test` for unit tests.


## cookbook
 
*  download, unpack, rename template into your new project dir
*  init git repo in your project  
*  exclude all unwanted routes in `app/app.routing.ts`
    * try to remove maximum stuff on this point. This will speed up builds a lot. 
    * Template has lot of splitting points allowing you to exclude plugin dependencies not just from build but even from webpack compilation.     
*  pick some route that is matching your idea. Or use `app/+misc/blank`, or generate new module with **angular-cli**
* now decide and chose what features are desired in your new project 
* perhaps maps, modals, some graphs, maybe voice-control and knobs...?
* include chosen modules from `app/shared/` subs into  your app's first 
* adjust navigation `app/shared/layout/navigation/navigation.component.html` 
   * (soon navigation will be configurable via json or `smartadmin.config.js`)
* run `npm run server:dev:hmr` to start dev server
* now it's time to get some data, to use in  your project. Or even Big Data? Collect from web API's, social networks, libraries; 
* explore, transform, display, analyze, edit. Angular 2 is really good for joining pieces together.
* until you have no backend with powerful db, use `localstorage` to gather results, persist data and even sync browser tabs 
* cleanup by deleting demo pages that are not matching your idea.  

### some tips 
* use angular-cli for code generating 
* choose and know your IDE, or try [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - it has good typescript support and brilliant resources usage. 
* use logs: if you cannot build, compile, deploy something, first place to locate error causers are log outputs
* create shortcuts for frequent git operations and commit your progress more often
* always automate DB backups.

## remarks
[1] If you, on some edging cases, can't build or run angular 2 projects, consider to try any virtual environment (i.e custom vagrant with some lightweight linux and nodejs@6.*.*)
